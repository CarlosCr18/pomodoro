## The project

This is a countdown session/break app.

- You select the session and break time then hit the start button and the countdown will begin.
- When the countdown reaches 0 It will play a sound effect and change the countdown status to either session or break time and a new countdown begins.
- the value is always be displayed in mm:ss format
- If the timer is running and You click the element Stop, the countdown will pause.
- If the timer is paused and You click the element Start, the countdown will resume running from the point at which it was paused.

It is easier to do your tasks if You do them in smaller chunks of time.

## Development

### Technologies

The technologies I used to develop this app are:

- CSS:
  It is implemented to style and animate the elements of the app and give the user feedback on the current state and the progress.

- Javascript:
  It is implemented to keep track of the countdown and format the time and to handle the behaviour when interacting with the app.

- React:
  It implements React with classes, It is used to keep track of the different status of data to be rendered and displayed to the user.

### Challenges

- Implementing the accurateInterval function and using it to determine the status of the app.

### What I would do different if I do it again

- I would use React hooks and functional components.
